# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

       **CO2 Emissions** above is **a Good Example** for Data Visualization because: \
      1. Itis simple appearance , 2 dimentional plot, not crowded with data \
      2. Easy to understand that China is the largest contributor for CO2 Emissions \
      3. One color is used, made it easy for our brain to process \
      4. data labels is used for more clarity \
      5. scale started from Zero, it is fair comparison \
      6. Horizontal lines used instead of grid or none, that made it easy to figure out the levels \

      \
       **Electricity Price Change** is **Bad Example** for Data Visualization for: \
      1. Different Scale is used for year 2013 than previous years \
      2. Tailored to tell different story than real one. \ 
      3. Biased toward **Mariano Rajoy** \
      4. X-Scale was per year for years before 2013, then changed to quarter for 2013, misleading and confuzing. \
      5. Confuzing type of bar charts used. 

    ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
    ```
   For the Bad example **( Electricity Price Change)**: \
      1.Using Simple Bar Chart  \
      2.Instead of plotting the percentage of change, plot real price for every kilowatt  \
      3. Use same scale for all years (per Year), so Y2013 will judged fairly.  \
      4. Use Horizontal Lines to make easier comparison \
      5. Add data labels on top of each bar \
      6. Use one color for all bars       \
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
